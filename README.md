WebGL spoofing settings in Kameleo

It can make your overall fingerprint a bit inconsistent if you choose it carelessly. If you leave on Automatic, then the metadata comes from the Basic profile, which is recommended.

WebGL spoofing in global settings
You can also set up a default WebGL spoofing value and WebGL metadata in the global settings. These values will be applied automatically when a new profile is created.
